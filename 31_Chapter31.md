# Explanation of Code Solution

The problem we're solving in this chapter is about generating the *nth* Fibonacci number. Let's take a look at the code solution we provided in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

This solution uses recursion to generate the *nth* Fibonacci number. Recursion is a technique that involves calling a function from within itself. In this solution, we call the `fibonacci` function with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments. We continue to call the `fibonacci` function with smaller values of `n`, until we reach the base case of `n <= 1`. Once we reach the base case, the function returns the value of `n`. 

Here's how the recursion works for a given value of `n`:

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, return `n`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, call the `fibonacci` function with `n-1` as the argument. This generates the `(n-1)th` Fibonacci number.
- Call the `fibonacci` function again, this time with `n-2` as the argument. This generates the `(n-2)th` Fibonacci number.
- Add the `(n-1)th` and `(n-2)th` Fibonacci numbers and return the sum.

The Fibonacci sequence is a popular problem in technical interviews, and this solution is a common way to approach it. However, it is important to note that this solution has a high time complexity, making it inefficient for large values of `n`. A more optimized solution would use dynamic programming or memoization to avoid unnecessary function calls and calculations.

In summary, the `fibonacci` function in this chapter's code solution uses recursion to generate the *nth* Fibonacci number by calling itself with smaller values of `n` until it reaches the base case. While this is a common approach to solving the Fibonacci problem, it is not the most efficient for large values of `n`.
