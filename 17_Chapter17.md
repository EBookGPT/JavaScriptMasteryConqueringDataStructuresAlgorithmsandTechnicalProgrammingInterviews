# JavaScript Mastery: Conquering Data Structures, Algorithms, and Technical Programming Interviews

## Chapter 17: Stack Data Structure

Welcome back to our journey of mastering JavaScript! In the previous chapter, we delved into the `Array` data structure and learned how to efficiently manipulate large sets of data in JavaScript. Today, we'll dive into the `Stack` data structure, which is another essential data structure in computer science.

A stack is a collection of elements that supports two principal operations: `push`, which adds an element to the collection, and `pop`, which removes the most recently added element. This collection is termed a `LIFO` (last-in-first-out) collection. The name "stack" is derived from the analogy of a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which when you remove an item from the top of the stack, it's the last one that was added and the rest remain unchanged in their position. 

The `Stack` data structure has a wide range of use cases in computer science, such as in handling function calls (method invocations), undo sequences in software applications, and parsing arithmetic operations. It is a foundation for the more complex data structures such as `queues`, `trees` and `graphs`.

In this chapter, we will explore the `Stack` data structure and its implementation in JavaScript. We will also examine different ways to implement stacks, such as using arrays and linked lists, and the best scenarios for each. We'll learn about the different traversals and search operations suitable for stacks.

Join me on this exciting journey, as we explore the `Stack` data structure and learn how to implement it efficiently in JavaScript. By mastering the stack data structure, you'll be well on your way to mastering data structures in JavaScript, which will prepare you for anything from technical interviews to real-world problem-solving.

Let's get started!

## Chapter 17: Stack Data Structure

### 17.1 Introduction to Stacks

A `stack` is a linear data structure in computer science that operates on `LIFO` (last-in-first-out) principle. It is a collection of elements that supports two primary operations: `push`, which adds an element to the collection; and `pop`, which removes the last added element. Stacks are essential in many computer science algorithms and have a wide range of use cases, such as in handling function calls (method invocations), undo sequences in software applications, and parsing arithmetic operations.

### 17.2 Implementing a Stack

There are several ways to implement a `Stack` data structure, including using arrays and linked lists. In this section, we'll explore the implementation details of a stack using JavaScript arrays and linked lists. We'll also dive into the time and space complexities of each implementation method.

### 17.3 Basic Stack Operations

We'll examine basic stack operations such as `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isFull`, `isEmpty`, in this section. We will also discuss other operations such as `search`, `traversal` and provide practical examples to show you how and when to use these stack operations.

### 17.4 Stack Applications

The `Stack` data structure is fundamental in computer science, and it finds its application in problem-solving, software development, and technical job interviews. In this section, we will examine and cover different practical stack applications that are used in real-world software development.

### 17.5 Time & Space Complexity

Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms is crucial to developing efficient algorithms. In this section, we'll dive into the theoretical background behind the time and space complexity of stack operations. We'll also cover the best use cases for JavaScript array and linked-list implementations of the stack data structure.

In conclusion, having a deep understanding of the `stack` data structure is crucial in mastering data structures in JavaScript. We hope that this chapter has provided you with a solid foundation to start exploring and implementing the stack data structure in your JavaScript applications. Keep practicing, and soon, you'll be solving complex algorithms with ease!
# Explanation of Stack Implementation with JavaScript Array

The `Stack` data structure is commonly implemented using arrays in JavaScript. In this section, we'll explore the code used to implement a stack using arrays in JavaScript.

```javascript
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
  }

  push(item) {
    this.stack.push(item);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.stack.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) {
      return "Stack is empty";
    }
    return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.stack.length === 0;
  }

  printStack() {
    let str = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < this.stack.length; i++) {
      str += this.stack[i] + " ";
    }
    return str;
  }
}
```
The `Stack` class is defined using the `class` keyword in JavaScript. The constructor initializes an empty array, which is used to store the stack data. 

## push(item) 

The `push(item)` method is used to push an item into the stack. It does this by leveraging the built-in `push()` array method of JavaScript. 

## pop() 

The `pop()` method is used to remove and return the last added element from the stack; it does this by leveraging the built-in `pop()` array method of JavaScript. To prevent errors from popping an empty stack, we add a guard clause that checks the length of the stack before running the `pop()` method. If the length of the stack is zero, which means it is empty, we return `Underflow` as an error message.

## peek() 

The `peek()` method returns the top element in the stack without modifying the stack. Like the `pop()` method, we have a guard clause that checks whether the stack is empty or not. 

## isEmpty() 

The `isEmpty()` method checks whether the stack is empty or not. It does this by checking the length of the stack. If the length is zero, the method returns `true`, else `false`.

## printStack() 

The `printStack()` method is used to print the contents of the stack. It is invoked by iterating through the stack array and concatenating each element into a string.



That's it! Now you understand how the `Stack` data structure is implemented using arrays in JavaScript. With this knowledge, you're ready to start using stacks in your JavaScript applications!
