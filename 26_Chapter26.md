# Chapter 26: Recursion in JavaScript

Welcome back, my fellow JavaScript enthusiasts! In the previous chapter, we discussed algorithmic strategies that can be used to solve complex problems. Now, we are diving headfirst into recursion- a programming technique that can leave many beginners scratching their heads. But don't worry, we're here to guide you every step of the way.

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and can be used to solve numerous problems effortlessly. We'll start by discussing the basics of recursion and how it works. We'll then move on to examining how recursion can be used to solve problems that may seem too difficult to solve iteratively.

Recursion can be difficult to implement and visualize, so we'll provide multiple examples to better illustrate how recursion works. We'll examine recursion in data structures like linked lists and binary trees and also touch on how recursion is utilized in functional programming in JavaScript.

But why should you care about recursion, you may ask? Well, mastering recursion can be the key to unlocking challenging technical interview questions, especially in companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon which are known to ask recursion-based questions to assess the problem-solving abilities of candidates.

So get ready to dive in and conquer recursion, one recursive function at a time! Let's get started!
# Chapter 26: Recursion in JavaScript

Recursion is a powerful technique that can make it easier to solve complex programming problems. In this chapter, we'll explore the basics of recursion in JavaScript and how it can be used to solve a range of problems. 

Here's what we'll cover in this chapter:

1. Understanding the fundamentals of recursion in JavaScript
2. Examining examples of simple recursive functions 
3. Covering the differences between recursive and iterative functions 
4. Using recursion in data structure manipulation 
5. Understanding recursion in functional programming 
6. Implementing binary tree traversals recursively 
7. Applying recursive algorithms to solve difficult technical interview questions 

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a thorough understanding of how recursion works and how it can be used to solve a variety of problems in JavaScript. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of recursion!
Sure! Here's an explanation of the recursive code used to solve a problem of calculating the sum of array elements:

```javascript
function sumArray(arr) {
  if(arr.length === 0) { // Base case check: return 0 if array is empty
    return 0;
  } else {
    return arr[0] + sumArray(arr.slice(1)); // Recursive call with sliced array excluding the first element
  }
}
``` 

The `sumArray` function takes an array as an argument and recursively calculates the sum of all the elements in the array. 

The function starts with a base case, which in this case checks if the array is empty. If the array is empty, we have reached the end of recursion and we can return 0 as the sum of an empty array is 0.

If the array is not empty, we add the first element of the array to a recursive call to the `sumArray()` function with the sliced array as the argument. The slice method creates a new array with all the elements of the original array except the first one. 

Calling `sumArray()` recursively with sliced arrays allows us to eventually reduce the original array to an empty array where the base case will be true, thus ending the recursion. 

By adding the first element of the original array on each recursive call, we gradually build up the sum of all the elements in the array.

That's the beauty and power of recursion! I hope this explanation helps you understand how this code works to calculate the sum of array elements recursively.
