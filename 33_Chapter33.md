Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code used to resolve the problem!

### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

### Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the left and right subtrees of every node and check if they differ by no more than 1. If the tree is balanced, we should return true, otherwise, we should return false.

We can implement this algorithm using a recursive approach. We define a helper function called `isBalancedHelper` that takes a node as an argument and returns its height. We then recursively call `isBalancedHelper` on the left and right subtrees of a node to get their heights. If the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, we return -1 (indicating that the tree is unbalanced). If the tree is balanced, we return the maximum height of its left and right subtrees, plus 1 (accounting for the current node).

Here is the code that implements this approach:

```javascript
function isBalanced(root) {
    return isBalancedHelper(root) !== -1;
}

function isBalancedHelper(node) {
    if (!node) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const leftHeight = isBalancedHelper(node.left);
    const rightHeight = isBalancedHelper(node.right);
    
    if (leftHeight === -1 || rightHeight === -1 || Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
}
```

The `isBalanced` function simply calls the `isBalancedHelper` function on the root node of the tree and checks if the return value is not -1.

The `isBalancedHelper` function first checks if the node exists. If the node is null, then we return a height of 0. Otherwise, we recursively call `isBalancedHelper` on the left and right subtrees of the node and store their heights in `leftHeight` and `rightHeight` respectively.

Next, we check if the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, or if either subtree is unbalanced (indicated by a height of -1). If either condition is true, we return -1. Otherwise, we return the maximum height of the left and right subtrees, plus 1.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node once. Overall, this code provides an efficient solution to the problem of determining whether a binary tree is height-balanced, using a recursive approach.
