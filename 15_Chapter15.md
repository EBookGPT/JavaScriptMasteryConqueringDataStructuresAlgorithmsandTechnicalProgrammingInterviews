# Chapter 15: Getting Started with Data Structures

Welcome to Chapter 15 of **JavaScript Mastery: Conquering Data Structures, Algorithms, and Technical Programming Interviews**! This chapter marks a significant milestone in your journey to become a Master of JavaScript. You are now ready to delve deeper into the world of Data Structures!

One of the crucial aspects of programming and problem-solving is the effective use of Data Structures. Efficient data organization and manipulation are key to solving complex real-world problems. In this chapter, we'll start by understanding what data structures are and how they are useful.

We'll cover the most popular data structures, including Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Graphs. We'll go over when and where to use them, learn how to implement them, and analyze their time and space complexities.

Here are some fun facts to keep in mind as we go through this chapter. Did you know that the Stack data structure is used in web browsers to implement the back and forward button feature? Or that the Queue data structure is commonly used in Operating Systems to schedule processes?

Data Structures are a fundamental part of programming and are widely used in the industry. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid foundation of the different types of data structures and be ready to tackle any problem that comes your way!

So, let's dive in and get started with Data Structures.

## 15.2 Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure used to store a collection of elements. These elements can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. In JavaScript, arrays are implemented as objects.

### Creating an Array

To create an array, we use square brackets `[]` and separate the elements with commas:

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements can be accessed using their index, which starts at 0 for the first element:

```javascript
console.log(array[0]); // Output: 1
console.log(array[2]); // Output: 3
```

### Array Methods

Arrays have various built-in methods that make manipulation and traversal of arrays easier. Here are some commonly used methods:

- **push():** adds one or more elements to the end of the array.
    ```javascript
    array.push(6); // array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```
- **pop():** removes the last element from the end of the array.
    ```javascript
    array.pop(); // array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
- **shift():** removes the first element from the beginning of the array.
    ```javascript
    array.shift(); // array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
- **unshift():** adds one or more elements to the beginning of the array.
    ```javascript
    array.unshift(0, 1); // array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
- **slice():** returns a new array containing a portion of the original array.
    ```javascript
    let newArray = array.slice(2, 4); // newArray = [2, 3]
    ```
- **splice():** adds, removes, or replaces elements in the array.
    ```javascript
    array.splice(2, 0, 2.5); // array = [0, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]
    array.splice(4, 2); // array = [0, 1, 2, 2.5, 5]
    array.splice(2, 2, 'a', 'b'); // array = [0, 1, 'a', 'b', 5]
    ```
- **concat():** concatenates two or more arrays into a new array.
    ```javascript
    let array2 = [6, 7, 8];
    let newArray = array.concat(array2); // newArray = [0, 1, 'a', 'b', 5, 6, 7, 8]
    ```
    
### Time and Space Complexity

It's essential to understand the Time and Space complexity of array operations. Most array operations have a time complexity of O(1) for indexing, push, pop, shift, unshift, and O(N) for splice, concat, and slice, where N is the size of the array.

The space complexity of an array is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
