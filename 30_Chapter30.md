# Chapter 30: Navigating Common Technical Programming Interview Questions

Welcome back to our ongoing journey towards JavaScript mastery! In the previous chapter, we learned about how to prepare for technical programming interviews. Today, we dive into the interview itself.

Technical programming interviews are a critical part of the hiring process. However, the thought of being asked a variety of technical questions can be overwhelming. In this chapter, we will explore common technical programming questions and discuss how to navigate them effectively.

To make this chapter extra special, we have invited a very special guest who is an expert in this field. Gayle Laakmann McDowell is the founder and CEO of CareerCup, a company focused on helping people navigate their technical interviews. She is also the author of "Cracking the Coding Interview," which has been widely regarded as the "Bible" for anyone who wants to ace a technical programming interview.

We are excited to have Gayle share her expertise with us, and we hope you will find this chapter incredibly valuable. Stay tuned for practical advice and code samples as we navigate the most common technical programming questions together. Let's get started!

# Explanation of Code: 

To navigate common technical programming interview questions, it's important to have a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. In this section, we'll review some important data structures and algorithms in JavaScript that you may be asked about during a technical programming interview.

## Stack Data Structure

A stack is a collection of elements, with two main operations: 

1. Push: adds an element to the top of the stack 
2. Pop: removes the top element from the stack 

The stack data structure is based on the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.

```javascript
/**
 * Stack Data Structure
 *
 * @class Stack
 */
class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.items.length === 0)
      return "Underflow";
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }

  printStack() {
    let str = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < this.items.length; i++)
      str += this.items[i] + " ";
    return str;
  }
}
```

The Stack class above provides the basic implementation of a stack data structure in JavaScript. The constructor initializes an empty array to store the elements of the stack. The push() method adds elements to the top of the stack, while the pop() method removes and returns the top element. To retrieve the top element without removing it, we can use the peek() method. The isEmpty() method checks if the stack is empty, while the printStack() method returns a string representation of the stack.

## Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

```javascript
/**
 * Bubble Sort Algorithm
 *
 * @function bubbleSort
 * @param {Array} arr - Array to be sorted
 * @returns {Array} - Sorted array
 */
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        const temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }

  return arr;
}
```

The bubbleSort() function above provides a basic implementation of the bubble sort sorting algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n^2). The function takes an array as input and returns a sorted array. It uses two nested for loops to iterate over the array and compare adjacent elements. If the elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped, and the process continues until the array is sorted.

These are just two examples of the data structures and algorithms that you may be asked about during a technical programming interview. By mastering these fundamentals and understanding their implementation in JavaScript, you'll be better prepared to navigate common technical programming interview questions.
