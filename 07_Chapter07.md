# Chapter 7: JavaScript Functions

Welcome to the seventh chapter of our book, "JavaScript Mastery: Conquering Data Structures, Algorithms, and Technical Programming Interviews." Now that we have covered loops in the last chapter, letâ€™s delve into another fundamental concept of the JavaScript programming language: functions.

Functions lie at the heart of JavaScript, and mastering them is essential to becoming a proficient programmer. They provide a way to organize code into reusable building blocks, enable abstraction over values and behaviors, and allow you to create code that works on a range of inputs.

This chapter will cover everything from the basics of function syntax to the more advanced concepts of higher-order functions and closures. We will also explore function-related data structures such as stacks and queues that will help illustrate these concepts.

We will start with the basics of writing a function, followed by declaring and invoking them with arguments and return values. We will cover the differences between declaring a function with a function declaration and a function expression, and how to convert between the two.

Functions are a common topic in technical programming interviews, so it is important that you learn how to write them efficiently and correctly. Additionally, knowing how to use different types of functions in various contexts is an essential skill for any software engineer.

So, let's dive into the world of JavaScript functions and see how we can leverage them to solve complex problems and become a master programmer.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain the code used to solve the problem!

```javascript
function fizzBuzz(num) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      console.log("Fizz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      console.log("Buzz")
    } else {
      console.log(i)
    }
  }
}
```

This code solves the classic FizzBuzz problem, which asks to print out numbers from 1 to a given `num`, except replacing any number divisible by 3 with "Fizz", any number divisible by 5 with "Buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

The `fizzBuzz` function takes a single parameter `num`, which is the end integer to count up to. 

We start by using a `for` loop to iterate through each integer from 1 up to and including `num`. Within the loop, we apply the following set of conditional statements:
- If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, we print "FizzBuzz".
- If `i` is divisible by 3 only, we print "Fizz".
- If `i` is divisible by 5 only, we print "Buzz".
- If none of the above conditions match (i.e., `i` is not divisible by 3 or 5), we simply print out the integer itself.

Note that we use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine divisibility. If `i % 3 === 0`, this means that `i` is divisible by 3 with no remainder, so this condition will evaluate true. 

Finally, we wrap the code for each condition in a `console.log` statement so that we can see the result in the console.

Overall, this code solves the FizzBuzz problem by cleverly using conditional statements to replace numbers divisible by 3 and/or 5 with their corresponding Fizz and/or Buzz values.
